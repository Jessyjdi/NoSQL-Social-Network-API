  ## Description
The Social Network API back-end is created as a part of UW Coding Bootcamp challenge. The application is built using the Mongoose, express and moment. The Major CRUD operations like GET, POST, PUT and Delete are involved in creating the User and adding the thoughts to the User and the reaction for their thoughts and moreover adding friends to the users network.


## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user‚Äôs friend list
```

## Installation

- Insomnia
- MongoDB Compass 
- Mongoose 
- Express
- Moment

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the application's User opertaions being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests ‚ÄúGET All User‚Äù, ‚ÄúGET user by Id‚Äù, ‚ÄúCreate a New User‚Äù, "Delete a User by Id" and "Update a User by id".](./Assets/User_Operations.gif)

## Database Models

**User**:

* `username`
  * String
  * Unique
  * Required
  * Trimmed

* `email`
  * String
  * Required
  * Unique
  * Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

* `thoughts`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

* `friends`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

* `thoughtText`
  * String
  * Required
  * Must be between 1 and 280 characters

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

* `username` (The user that created this thought)
  * String
  * Required

* `reactions` (These are like replies)
  * Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

* `reactionId`
  * Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  * Default value is set to a new ObjectId

* `reactionBody`
  * String
  * Required
  * 280 character maximum

* `username`
  * String
  * Required

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

* `GET` all users

* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

```json
// example data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

* `GET` to get all thoughts

* `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

* `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**

* `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

* `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value
